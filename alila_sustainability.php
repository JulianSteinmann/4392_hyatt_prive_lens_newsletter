      <h5>AN EXPERIENCE STORY</h5>
      <h1>For the Love of Earth—and Coconuts—in Bali</h1>
      <p>In Bahasa Indonesia, cinta Alam means “Love of Earth.” This concept is at the heart of everything at <strong><strong>Alila Seminyak</strong></strong>, where glass water bottles become sleek drinkware and discarded coconuts find new life as organic planters. As global leaders in sustainable tourism, Alila Hotels & Resorts launched the “Zero Waste to Landfill” project in August 2016, challenging its flagship Bali resorts to eliminate all waste. The result? Creative initiatives that inspire colleagues and guests to connect even further with their natural surroundings.</p>

      <h2>Caring For the Island of the Gods</h2>
      <p>Philanthropist and entrepreneur Jay Pritzker founded Park Hyatt in 1979. His vision for the brand was deeply personal—and inspired by his love of extraordinary food and wine, culture, and the arts. Pritzker set out to create a “home away from home” that captured the personalized, intuitive service and understated elegance of his favorite small European hotels.</p>
      <p>Colleagues at <strong>Alila Seminyak</strong> take their environmental stewardship seriously—just ask Aras Alam, chief of engineering. “We are always learning, always taking on new projects and thinking of new ideas for making the property more sustainable,” he explains.</p>

      <h2>Building Greener</h2>
      <p>Walking into <strong>Alila Seminyak</strong>, one might not realize how thoughtfully attuned the building is to its natural surroundings. Built on a delectable slice of sandy beach, the luxury resort’s design weaves contemporary architecture into open, airy lounge spaces and lushly landscaped terraces. Beyond appealing aesthetics, <strong>Alila Seminyak</strong>’s design is grounded in sustainability and a celebration of its locale.</p>
      <p>The use of local building materials and the incorporation of environmental, energy and resource-efficient systems are also integral to the design. Interior finishes include certified recycled or reclaimed ulin wood, local Batu Jogia stone, and terrazzo flooring made by local, independent village craftsmen. An open-plan layout harnesses natural sea breezes to reduce energy use.</p>

    <h2>No If’s, And’s, or Wasted Coconuts</h2>
    <p>Every product passing through <strong>Alila Seminyak</strong> is repurposed—even rainwater is filtered and transformed into freshwater. Leafy greens, peppers, and fragrant herbs are grown pesticide-free in the hotel’s on-site hydroponic water garden.</p>
    <p>And who could forget the coconuts? No trip to Bali is complete without sipping a fresh kelapa muda (young coconut) by the beach, but they are difficult to discard—adding to the island’s ongoing challenges with waste. Instead, <strong>Alila Seminyak</strong> takes the finished coconuts from their outlets and reuses them as organic planters.</p>

  <h2>Naturally Sweet</h2>
  <p>Can the zero-waste concept work behind the bar, too? Seasalt at <strong>Alila Seminyak</strong> rose to the challenge. Single-use plastic straws are long gone, replaced by straws made from natural sugarcane. The Stretched Pineapple cocktail, a fresh twist on a modern mojito, is garnished with pineapple candy made from dried, fermented pineapple meat. The award-winning mixology team also crafts their own specialty syrups, using every last bit of fruit juices, rinds, and seeds to sweeten each cocktail naturally. Bali’s zero-waste initiative serves as an example that Alila properties worldwide hope to emulate. Alam says he hopes <strong>Alila Seminyak</strong>’s efforts inspire their guests as well, reminding us that “every small change can make a big difference.”</p>
