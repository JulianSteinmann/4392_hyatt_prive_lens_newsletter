      <h5>VOLUME ONE</h5>
      <h1>Celebrating 40 Years of Park Hyatt</h1>
      <p>We are delighted to celebrate 40 years of our Park Hyatt brand -- four decade of exceptional service, renowned art and architecture, rare culinary experiences, and unexpected pleasures. Discerning travelers know that true luxury is personal—whether it’s an animated discussion of modern art over an aged, single-malt scotch or an intimate lesson in delicate Japanese calligraphy. Park Hyatt hotels specialize in these sophisticated connections.</p>

      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>Philanthropist and entrepreneur Jay Pritzker founded Park Hyatt in 1979. His vision for the brand was deeply personal—and inspired by his love of extraordinary food and wine, culture, and the arts. Pritzker set out to create a “home away from home” that captured the personalized, intuitive service and understated elegance of his favorite small European hotels.</p>

      <h2>Iconic Art, Architecture & Design</h2>
      <p>World-class design has remained at the heart of the Park Hyatt brand, from the legendary Chicago property that started it all to development spanning from Marrakech to Mexico City. Each hotel draws from its location to create a singularly unique experience through stunning architecture, fine furnishings, and expertly curated art collections.</p>
      <p>Long before "Lost In Translation" brought the hotel film fame, <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/japan/park-hyatt-tokyo/tyoph?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_aspac_tyoph" class="content-link" target="_blank">Park Hyatt Tokyo</a> debuted at the top of a 52-story Shinjuku tower and redefined the meaning of luxury hospitality in Japan. In the Austrian capital, a century-old bank transformed into a masterpiece of opulent, contemporary design at <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/austria/park-hyatt-vienna/vieph?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_eame_vieph" class="content-link" target="_blank">Park Hyatt Vienna</a>.</p>
      <p>Across the pond in Midtown Manhattan, a multi-million dollar art collection set a new standard of luxury at <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/new-york/park-hyatt-new-york/nycph?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_nam_nycph" class="content-link" target="_blank">Park Hyatt New York</a>. Here, the Manhattan Sky Suite, New York City’s highest hotel suite, has recently debuted overlooking unmatched views of Central Park and the city skyline from the 59th floor. In true Park Hyatt fashion, the Manhattan Sky Suite offers worldly guests an elevated luxury NYC experience, with complimentary helicopter airport transfer, dedicated butler service, a personal chef, and much more.</p>

    <h2>Masters of Food & Wine</h2>
    <p>Furthering Jay Pritzker’s original vision for the brand, Park Hyatt launched its Masters of Food & Wine program in 2003. The series showcases Park Hyatt chefs, sommeliers, and specialists through intimate, immersive culinary and beverage events all over the world.</p>
    <p>Past Masters of Food & Wine events include a twilight fishing excursion and traditional cooking class at <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/maldives/park-hyatt-maldives-hadahaa/mldph?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_swa_mldph" class="content-link" target="_blank">Park Hyatt Maldives Hadahaa</a> and a visit to local Argentine olive groves with an olive oil tasting at <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/argentina/park-hyatt-mendoza-hotel-casino-and-spa/menph?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_latam_menph" class="content-link" target="_blank">Park Hyatt Mendoza</a>. No two Masters of Food & Wine events are alike. Coming soon to <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/switzerland/park-hyatt-zurich/zurph?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_eame_zurph" class="content-link" target="_blank">Park Hyatt Zurich</a>, Executive Chef Frank Widmer will guide guests through a cozy Swiss chalet dinner, grilling a carefully selected menu of seasonal favorites, paired with LVMH wines.</p>
