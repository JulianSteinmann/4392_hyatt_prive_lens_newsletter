      <h2>Ski-in, ski-out, and brave the Back Bowls in Vail</h2>
      <p>Mentioning “Vail” in conversation conjures up fond images of powdery slopes and valley vistas. Colorado’s Vail Mountain is one of the most beloved ski destinations in the world. New to the Hyatt portfolio this year, <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/colorado/grand-hyatt-vail/egegh?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_nam_egegh" class="content-link" target="_blank">Grand Hyatt Vail</a> is poised to make a memorable winter debut this season.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s conquering Vail’s infamous Back Bowls or sticking to the blue runs, there’s something here for every skier or snowboarder to enjoy. Ski-in and ski-out with ease—Chairlift 20 is right outside, ready to whisk hotel guests straight up the mountain. Aching muscles are eased with deep-tissue massages or luxe body treatments at the on-site spa. Outside, a forest creek flows by the property’s steamy infinity pool and hot tubs. </p>

      <h2>An upscale mountain retreat tucked beside Lake Tahoe</h2>
      <p>Tucked within the Sierra Nevada mountains, <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/nevada/hyatt-regency-lake-tahoe-resort-spa-and-casino/tvllt?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_nam_tvllt" class="content-link" target="_blank">Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort</a> is a blissful lakeside retreat year-round. Winter, though, is nothing short of magical. Complimentary shuttle service connects the hotel to Diamond Peak Ski Resort, just two miles away. There’s terrain suitable for all levels, but it’s the sweeping, scenic Lake Tahoe views that keep skiers coming back season after season.</p>
      <p>No sun? No problem. If the snow’s falling, guests can avoid the winter chill and enter the hotel’s heated pool from inside. Exquisite culinary offerings can also be found within the resort. The menu at Lone Eagle Grille is carefully curated with local flavors of the high-Sierra, like fresh seafood, game meats, and creative vegetarian dishes.</p>

    <h2>High-altitude Alpine adventures await at La Rosière</h2>
    <p>The French Alps are calling — <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/france/hyatt-centric-la-rosiere/cmfct?src=corp_lclb_gmb_seo_eame_cmfct" class="content-link" target="_blank">Hyatt Centric La Rosière</a> is now part of Hyatt Privé! C’est bon. Or should we say, va bene? La Rosière is the ideal base camp for border-free skiing between France and Italy. Since a breakfast pain au chocolat pairs well with a satisfying pasta lunch, simply ski right across the Petit Saint-Bernard Pass into La Thuile, Italy.</p>
    <p>When it comes to high-altitude adrenaline, La Rosière has guests covered. From heli-skiing to night sledging, this ski-in, ski-out resort boasts more than enough Alpine adventures to get the blood pumping. We’ll let you in on another secret: The sunny terrace at H40 is the place to après-ski and be seen. La Rosière receives as many hours of daily sunshine as St. Tropez and Cannes.</p>
